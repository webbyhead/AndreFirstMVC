# AndreFirstMVC

This is a sample Microsoft MVC created using .NET 6 Core

It uses:

1. One Model - Dog with Name and Age

2. Two Views:
- One Index Page - Index View
- One Create Page - Create View

3. One Controller - Hello World


The MVC prompts the user to enter a dog's name and age.
When Submit is clicked it displays the Dog's name and Age on the Index Page
